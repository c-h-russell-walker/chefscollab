* One-click restore
* Backup automatically on a repeating schedule
* Files and databases can have separate schedules
* Failed uploads are automatically resumed/retried

* Download backup archives direct from your WordPress dashboard
* Database backups can be encrypted for security
* Debug mode that gives full logging of the backup
* Thousands of users: widely tested and reliable
* Premium/multi-site version and support available - <a href="http://updraftplus.com">http://updraftplus.com</a>

= Don't Risk Anything Less =

Your backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to plugins with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backing or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

= Best New WordPress Plugin =

That's according to WordPress big cheese, Vladimir Prelovac. Check out his weekly chart to see where UpdraftPlus is right now: http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins-rising-stars

= UpdraftPlus Addons And Premium =

UpdraftPlus is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional, with no annoying omissions. What we do have is various extra features, and guaranteed support, available <a href="http://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>.

If you need WordPress multisite compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.

= Professional / Enterprise support agreements available =

UpdraftPlus is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a>

= Other support =

We hang out in the support forum for this plugin - http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus - however, to save our time so that we can spend it on development, please read the plugin's Frequently Asked Questions - <a href="http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/">http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/</a> - before going there, and ensure that you have updated to the latest released version of UpdraftPlus.

== Installation ==

<a href="http://updraftplus.com/download/">Please go here for full instructions</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<a href="http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/"><strong>Please go here for the full FAQs.</strong></a> Below are just a handful which apply to the free wordpress.org version, or which bear repeating.

= Can UpdraftPlus do <something>? =

Check out <a href="http://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a>.

= I found a bug. What do I do? =

Firstly, please make sure you read this FAQ through to the end - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk/donate); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.

If it does not, then contact me! This is a complex plugin and the only way I can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.

Please turn on debugging mode (in the UpdraftPlus options page) and then try again, and after that send me the log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, etcetera).

If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send me multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).

If you are a programmer and can send a patch, then that's even better.

Finally, if you post in the WordPress support forum, then make sure you include the word UpdraftPlus in your post; otherwise I will not be automatically notified that you posted.

= Anything essential to know? =

After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.

= My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars! =

UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then your solution is to purchase better web hosting, or to hire me professionally. Otherwise, this is not considered a bug. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= How is this better than the original Updraft? =

You can check the changelog for changes; but the original Updraft, before I forked it, had three major problems. Firstly, it only backed up WP core tables from the database; if any of your plugins stored data in extra tables, then they were not backed up. Secondly, it only backed up your plugins/themes/uploads and not any further directories inside wp-content that other plugins might have created. Thirdly, the database backup did not include charset information, which meant that you needed to know some SQL wizardry to actually be able to use the backup. I made UpdraftPlus out of my experience of trying to back up several sites with Updraft. Then, I added encryption for the database file for extra peace of mind, and future-proofed by getting rid of some deprecated aspects. Since then, many new features have been added, e.g. resuming of failed uploads, and Dropbox support.

= Any known bugs ? =

Not a bug, but one issue to be aware of is that backups of very large sites (lots of uploaded media) are quite complex matters, given the limits of running inside WordPress on a huge variety of different web hosting setups. With large sites, you need to use Amazon S3, which UpdraftPlus supports (since 0.9.20), Google Drive (0.9.21), Dropbox (since 1.2.19) or WebDAV (since 1.4.30), because these support chunked, resumable uploads. Other backup methods have code (since 0.9.0) to retry failed uploads of an archive, but the upload cannot be chunked, so if an archive is enormous (i.e. cannot be completely uploaded in the time that PHP is allowed for running on your web host) it cannot work.

= My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you? =

No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is working correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.

= I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade? =

Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.

= Have you written any other free plugins? =

Thanks for asking - yes, I have. Check out my profile page - http://profiles.wordpress.org/DavidAnderson/ . I am also available for hire for bespoke work.
